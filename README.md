# Self-Learning
Various projects/projects from my self-learning data science


### A. Titanic Survivor Prediction ###
  
  In this project, I have used simple machine learning models to predict if a passenger would survive or not. Most of the prediction was based on using one feature, for each prediction, I have tried different models (Linear Regression, Random Forest, and Decision Tree) and checked which model would give the best result and the result is evaluted using Mean Absolute Error. The models can definitely be improved by combining different features and I am currently working on it to get better results to submit on Kaggle. 
  

### B.MuscleHub A/B Test ###

  In this project, I started gathering data by using SQL queries. Then did several A/B tests to test if a group is more likely to purchase a membership or pick up an application. All those A/B tests are accompanied by a chi2-test to see whether the result is statistically significant. 

### C. Biodiversity Test ###

  In this project, I read csv files into pandas dataframe tables and investigated the conservation status of the species and whether the species need protection or not. Skills used: pivot table, table merging, data visualization, data groupby, etc...


### D. Seaborn Data Visualization Cumulative Project###

  In this project, I used different types of charts to visualize the loan awarded by Kiva. The figures are drawn by comparing the awardee's country, gender, etc.
